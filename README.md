# Random Photos

This project is a simple webpage that displays a grid of random images using the Picsum API. The images are displayed inside a container with a shadow effect, and there is a button that allows you to load more images to the container. Clicking the button will add 9 new images to the container, each with a unique random number assigned to it by the API. The webpage also includes some basic styling using CSS, such as setting the background color and adding some padding to the button. Overall, it's a simple but fun project for displaying a variety of random images on a webpage.
